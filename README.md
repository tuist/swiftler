# Swiftler

A utility for calling Swift code from Elixir, similar to how Rustler works for Rust. Swiftler provides seamless integration between Elixir and Swift through dynamic binary generation and automatic NIF binding generation.

## Features

- ðŸš€ **Dynamic Binary Integration**: Swift code is compiled into dynamic binaries and integrated through Elixir's NIF system
- ðŸ”§ **Swift Package Manager**: Uses SPM as the build system, following Swift ecosystem conventions
- ðŸ“¦ **Mix Tasks**: Provides `mix swift.compile` and `mix swift.clean` tasks similar to Rustler
- ðŸŽ¯ **Automatic Bindings**: Swift macros for automatic NIF binding generation
- ðŸ§ª **Testing Support**: Includes Swift Testing framework integration
- ðŸ’¼ **Minimal Dependencies**: Lightweight approach with minimal C-related dependencies

## Installation

Add `swiftler` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:swiftler, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

### 1. Add Swiftler as a Package Dependency

Create a Swift package or add Swiftler to your existing package dependencies:

```swift
// Package.swift
let package = Package(
    name: "YourProject",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/tuist/swiftler.git", from: "0.1.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "YourProject",
            dependencies: ["Swiftler"]
        )
    ]
)
```

### 2. Define Swift Functions with Swiftler Macros

Use Swiftler's macros to define functions that can be called from Elixir:

```swift
import Swiftler

#nifLibrary(name: "adder", functions: [add(_:_:)])

@nif func add(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int {
    a + b
}

@nif func greet(_ name: String) -> String {
    "Hello, \(name) from Swift!"
}
```

### 3. Compile Swift Code

Run the Mix task to compile your Swift code:

```bash
mix swift.compile
```

### 4. Create Elixir NIF Module

Define your Elixir module to load the NIF:

```elixir
defmodule YourProject.Math do
  @on_load :load_nifs

  def load_nifs do
    :erlang.load_nif('./priv/libswiftler', 0)
  end

  def add(_a, _b), do: :erlang.nif_error(:nif_not_loaded)
  def greet(_name), do: :erlang.nif_error(:nif_not_loaded)
end
```


### 5. Use in Your Application

```elixir
YourProject.Math.add(5, 3)
# => 8

YourProject.Math.greet("World")
# => "Hello, World from Swift!"
```

## Mix Tasks

- `mix swift.compile` - Compiles the Swift package and generates static libraries
- `mix swift.clean` - Cleans Swift build artifacts

## Architecture

Swiftler follows a macro-driven approach:

1. Swift macros (`@nif` and `#nifLibrary`) generate C-compatible NIF code at compile time
2. Swift code is compiled into a dynamic library using Swift Package Manager
3. The dynamic library contains C-compatible functions that can be loaded as NIFs
4. Elixir loads the dynamic library and calls Swift functions through the NIF interface

## Development Status

Swiftler is currently in development. The macro system generates C-compatible NIF code from Swift functions, and dynamic library generation is working. The project now supports the swift-nif API pattern with `@nif` function decorators and `#nifLibrary` declarations.

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
mix test
```

The tests verify that:
- Swift compilation works correctly
- Dynamic binaries are generated
- Elixir macros create proper function stubs
- Type validation works as expected
- NIF integration functions properly
